# Notes:

https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html

`eslint-plugin-prettier`
`stylelint-prettier`

> These plugins were especially useful when Prettier was new. By running Prettier inside your linters, you didnâ€™t have to set up any new infrastructure and you could re-use your editor integrations for the linters. But these days you can run `prettier --check`. and most editors have Prettier support.
